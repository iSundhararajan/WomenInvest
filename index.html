    <h1>ABOUT US<br><br></h1>
    <p>Did you know that investments in WMBEs are 80 percent lower than the median investment in businesses overall. This means that investors have a large blind spot when it comes to how they are investing in these businesses. But why is that?
        Investors Are Less Exposed to Minority-Owned Businesses and Donâ€™t Seek to Diversify Candidates. <br><br>
        We are here to make the access to the databse of minority lead startups, alongside VC investors and coporations, easier than ever!
